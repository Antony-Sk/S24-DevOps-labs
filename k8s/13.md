## Bonus task: update strategies


1. RollingUpdate: This is the default update strategy in Kubernetes. With RollingUpdate, new pods are gradually created and the old pods are gradually terminated. This ensures that the application remains available and stable during the update process. RollingUpdate allows for controlled and incremental changes to the cluster, minimizing downtime and disruptions.

2. Recreate: In the Recreate update strategy, all existing pods are terminated before new pods are created. This results in a brief downtime as the old pods are replaced with the new ones. Recreate is a simpler and faster update strategy compared to RollingUpdate, but it can lead to service disruptions if not planned and executed properly.

3. Blue/Green deployment: In this update strategy, two identical environments (blue and green) are maintained, with only one environment actively serving traffic at a time. When an update is needed, the new version of the application is deployed to the inactive environment (e.g., green), and traffic is switched to the updated environment once it is deemed stable. Blue/Green deployments minimize downtime and allow for easy rollback to a previous version if issues arise.
