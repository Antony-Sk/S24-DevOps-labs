## Python web app
I chose Flask because it is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python, making it well-suited for creating simple web applications like this one.

Best practicies:

1. Unittesting of endpoint: now there is a test that checks that time got in right format 
2. Using pylint for better codestyle
3. Coding standards: pylint follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code, which is the standard for Python coding conventions.
