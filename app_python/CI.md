# Best Practices for CI Workflows

1. Snyk for Vulnerabilities Checks: Incorporate Snyk into your CI workflow to scan for vulnerabilities in your code and dependencies. By regularly checking for security issues, you can proactively address potential threats and ensure the safety of your application.

2. Badge for Status: Utilize badges in your CI workflows to provide quick visual indicators of build status, test coverage, and other relevant metrics. By including badges in your project README or documentation, you can easily communicate the current state of your codebase to team members and stakeholders.

3. Docker Integration: Integrate Docker into your CI workflow to streamline the build and deployment process. Docker containers provide a consistent environment for testing and running applications, making it easier to deploy code across different environments and platforms.

4. Flake8 as Linter: Use Flake8 as a linter in your CI workflow to enforce code style and maintain consistency throughout your codebase. Linters help identify potential issues and ensure that code meets best practices and standards.

5. Build Cache: Implement build caching in your CI workflow to speed up the build process and reduce build times. By caching dependencies and intermediate build artifacts, you can avoid unnecessary recompilation and improve overall build performance.
